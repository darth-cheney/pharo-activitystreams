I am an ActivityStreams Object representing a content object that has been deleted.

I can be used in Collections (Collection etc) to identify that there used to be an objectin that position that has since been deleted.

See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Tombstone for more information.

 Notes: 
              A Tombstone represents a content object that has been deleted. It can be used in Collections to signify that there used to be an object at this position, but it has been deleted.
