I am an ActivityStream Object that describes some form of action that may happen, is currently happening, or has already happened. I inherit all properties of the base Object. I am an abstract class for all types of activity, and as such do not carry any specific semantics about the kind of action being taken.

See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Activity for more information.

 Notes: 
            An Activity is a subtype of Object that describes some form of action that may happen, is currently happening, or has already happened. The Activity type itself serves as an abstract base type for all types of activities. It is important to note that the Activity type itself does not carry any specific semantics about the kind of action being taken.
