 Notes: 
            A Link is an indirect, qualified reference to a resource identified by a URL. The fundamental model for links is established by [
            RFC5988]. Many of the properties defined by the Activity Vocabulary allow values that are either instances of
            Object or Link. When a Link is used, it establishes a
            qualified relation connecting the subject (the containing object) to the resource identified by the href. Properties of the Link are properties of the reference as opposed to properties of the resource.
