I represent an ActivityStream Object of any kind, except for Link (ASLink). See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Object for more information.

I serve as the base class for other types of objects defined by the ActivityStream Vocabulary (https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary). I know how to serialize / deserialize myself and basic ActivityStream objects to and from JSON, which is the primary function of ActivityStreams.

For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them.
