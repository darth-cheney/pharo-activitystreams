I am an ActivityStream Activity type that indicates the actor has added the object to the target. See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Add for more information.

Note that if the target is not explicitly specified, it will need to be determined from the context, and the origin can be used to identify the context from which the object originated.

 Notes: 
              Indicates that the actor has added the
              object to the target. If the
              target property is not explicitly specified, the target would need to be determined implicitly by context. The
              origin can be used to identify the context from which the object originated.
