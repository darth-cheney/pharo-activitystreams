I am an ActivityStream Activity object indicating that the actor has updated the object. Note that this doesn't indicate anything about how the actor has modified or otherwise updated the object, just that it has happened. The target and origin typically have no meaning for this activity. See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Update for more information.

 Notes:  
                Indicates that the actor has updated the
                object. Note, however, that this vocabulary does not define a mechanism for describing the actual set of modifications made to object.
               
                The target and
                origin typically have no defined meaning.
