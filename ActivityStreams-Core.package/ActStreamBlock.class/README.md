I am an ActivityStream Activity object indicating that the actor is blocking the object. Blocking is a stronger form of Ignore, and therefore I am a subclass of Ignore. The target and origin usually have no meanining for this activity. See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Block for more information.

 Notes: 
              Indicates that the actor is blocking the
              object. Blocking is a stronger form of
              Ignore. The typical use is to support social systems that allow one user to block activities or content of other users. The target and origin typically have no defined meaning.
