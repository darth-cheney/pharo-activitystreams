I am an ActivityStream Object that describes some form of action that may happen, is currently happening, or has already happened. I inherit all properties of the base ASObject. I am an abstract class for all types of activity, and as such do not carry any specific semantics about the kind of action being taken.

See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Activity for more information.
