I am an ActivityStream IntransitiveActivity object indicating that the actor is traveling to the target from the origin. If target or origin are not set, either can be determined from the context. See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Travel for more information.

 Notes: 
              Indicates that the actor is traveling to
              target from origin. Travel is an IntransitiveObject whose actor specifies the direct object. If the target or
              origin are not specified, either can be determined by context.
