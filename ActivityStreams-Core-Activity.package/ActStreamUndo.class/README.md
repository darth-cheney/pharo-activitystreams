I am an ActivityStream Activity object indicating the actor is undoing the object. In most cases, the object will be some other Activity (Activity or subclass) describing some previously performed action. The target and origin typically have no meaning for this activity. See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Undo for more information.

                Indicates that the actor is undoing the
                object. In most cases, the object will be an Activity describing some previously performed action (for instance, a person may have previously "liked" an article but, for whatever reason, might choose to undo that like at some later point in time).
               
                The target and origin typically have no defined meaning.
