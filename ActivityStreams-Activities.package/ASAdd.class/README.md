I am an ActivityStream Activity type that indicates the actor has added the object to the target. See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Add for more information.

Note that if the target is not explicitly specified, it will need to be determined from the context, and the origin can be used to identify the context from which the object originated.
