I am an ActivityStream Activity that indicates that the actor "accepts" the object. The target property can be used in certain circumstances to indicate the context into which the object has been accepted.

See https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Accept for more information.

I am a subclass of ASActivity.
